    <h2>Uninstall</h2>

	<h3 id="windows">Windows XP/Vista</h3>
	<h4>Windows XP</h4>
	First check that you are using an account with administrative permissions. In Windows Vista it is necessary to execute the installer with special administrative permissions. So, a command prompt window with administrator rights is needed. To create one you need to:
	
	<br /><br /><code>Go to Start > All Programs > Accessories > then right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".</code>

	<br /><br />Then change directory to the one that has the installer and change to the directory Uninstaller, then execute:
	
	<br /><br /><code>uninstall.bat</code>

	REPOX has only been tested in Ubuntu. If you are using another distribution, the Jetty service may have to be uninstalled manually. To uninstall REPOX you need to use root or be a sudoer. Open a terminal and change the directory to the one that has the installer, and inside that one to the directory Uninstaller. If you are logged with root execute:
	
	<br /><br /><code>uninstall.sh</code>
	
	<br /><br />If you are logged with a used which has sudoer permission execute:
	
	<br /><br /><code>sudo uninstall.sh</code>
